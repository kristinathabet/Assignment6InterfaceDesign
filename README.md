# DH110 Assignment 6: Interface Design by Kristina Thabet
## Project Description
### Summary 
The following interactive prototype is created to illustrate the process of navigating a website in order to find information about changing your name on your drivers license. This process includes deciding whether users have a Real ID or a Standard license, deciding which way to submit this change, and how to mail your request for this change. 

### Process 
The prototype was created using Figma, a browser generally used for prototyping and wireframing. I have used Figma in the past to create simple visualizations and wireframes for past projects. I began by conducting a low-fidelity prototype and testing it with a participant to see where my design is flawed or unclear. I then utilized Figma to digitize my paper wireframes created in the low- fidelity prototype in order to add clear, graphic and visual components to my wireframe. I tested many different colors and themes to ensure I find one that alligns with the intention of this project: to easily aquire knowledge about changing information on an existing license, and provide users with a simple process to complete this change. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this interactive prototype is to have a clear visualization of the proposed tasks users will complete and to ensure the interaction flow of the wireframes is logical and clear for the user. It is also a way to analyze if the graphic and visual components of the app are compatible with the information presented. This prototype is designed to be tested by prospective users before spending large sums of money developing the app.

## Typographic Variations (3)

After assessing all three of these typographic variations, I decided that the Roboto white font is most appropriate for my application. The botton font size is 24 and the title font size is 30 and bolded. The white font makes the application seem less harsh compared to the black and caps lock font. The white typography contrasts nicely with the muted blue background, making the words easy to read and still visually plerasing to look at. Although I do believe that the all caps lock font is clearer to read, it comes off as slightly aggressive and unfitting for the purpose of this high-fidelity prototype.
## Shape Variations (3)

The overall look and feel of the screen that is most harmonious with the contents of my application is the variation on the right. The rounded edges are most appropriate for a button feature because it implies a need to click on something. The border around the button also differentiates buttons from other shapes that have rounded edges, demising confusion about what is a button and what is not. Having the text centered on the button also makes the most sense visually.


## Color Scheme Variations (2)

I decided to stick with colors that can be applicable to any informative website dealing with driver's license paperwork. The beige color scheme variation looked a little bit outdated and not fitting for an app that is completing DMV tasks. The dark blue color scheme is very clean, easy to read, and neutral enough to be applicable to DMV tasks.
