# DH110 Assignment 6: Interface Design by Kristina Thabet
## Project Description
### Summary 
The following interactive prototype is created to illustrate the process of navigating a website in order to find information about changing your name on your drivers license. This process includes deciding whether users have a Real ID or a Standard license, deciding which way to submit this change, and how to mail your request for this change. 

### Process 
The prototype was created using Figma, a browser generally used for prototyping and wireframing. I have used Figma in the past to create simple visualizations and wireframes for past projects. I began by conducting a low-fidelity prototype and testing it with a participant to see where my design is flawed or unclear. I then utilized Figma to digitize my paper wireframes created in the low- fidelity prototype in order to add clear, graphic and visual components to my wireframe. I tested many different colors and themes to ensure I find one that alligns with the intention of this project: to easily aquire knowledge about changing information on an existing license, and provide users with a simple process to complete this change. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this interactive prototype is to have a clear visualization of the proposed tasks users will complete and to ensure the interaction flow of the wireframes is logical and clear for the user. It is also a way to analyze if the graphic and visual components of the app are compatible with the information presented. This prototype is designed to be tested by prospective users before spending large sums of money developing the app.
